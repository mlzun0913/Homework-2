      <p>My name is Milton Zuniga and I have been a high school English teacher/university professor for 13 years. Throughout my career, I have served in various roles in the field of education. I have had the pleasure of teaching kindergarten to twelfth grade students in remedial and advanced classes. I have taught writing, literature, ESL and creative writing courses to undergraduate students. In addition, I have served in various leadership teams as well as an educational consultant for school improvement goals. Also, I have developed and supervised curricula across multiple disciplines and levels. </p>

      <p>My education, BA, MA and MS degrees and are from American universities and most of my experience has been in classrooms in the US where I have a teaching license from the state of Florida. The last two years I have had the pleasure of working at the Institute of Applied Technology (IAT) in Abu Dhabi but now I am searching for opportunities for professional growth.</p>
